FKW is a website-profiler. Starting from a parent-weblink one can retrieve all the child-links (to a certain depth). Next one can create a short profile per weblink, so that the usefullness of the website can be assessed without entering it (or at least that is the idea). FKW is a web-app running in the browser. Furthermore, FWK should be ready-to-run, that is not needing additional package-installations except for the executable and the co-delivered data-files.


INSTALLATION ON WINDOWS
- unzip the file, place it somewhere in your user-folder. (i myself have in my user-folder a subfolder "applications" in which i have placed ready-to-run apps).
- run the executable "freek_startup".
- add a permission to the firewall or other barriers that microsoft throws up against independent non-commercial developers.
- To access the web-server you just started (and thus start the app), type in your browser: http://localhost:5200/freek


INSTALLATION ON LINUX
- Just unpack, place it somewhere in your user-folder. 
- run the executable "freek_startup" as follows. 
  - Open a terminal, 
  - go to the folder which contains freek_startup
  - type: ./freek_startup
  - press enter
- To access the web-server you just started (and thus start the app), type in your browser: http://localhost:5200/freek
